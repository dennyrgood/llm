Video editing with Flux

will this do restoration of old bw photos, fill in missing limbs, that sort of thing ... colorize?

Yes – absolutely. The exact same RTX 3060 12GB + local Flux/ComfyUI setup I recommended for background removal is currently the best tool on the planet in 2025 for:Restoring old black-and-white photos  
Colorizing them realistically (better than MyHeritage or anything commercial)  
Filling in missing faces, limbs, torn corners, scratches, water damage  
Reconstructing completely missing parts of people (e.g., half a face blown out → perfect reconstruction)
