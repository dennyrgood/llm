**ChatGPT history**

**You said:**

Best gpu to get the best flux at home image manipulation. Along with
model sizes/names

**ChatGPT said:**

If you want the "best GPU" for home use with what you refer to as "flux
/ image manipulation" (I assume you mean modern AI-based image
generation / editing, e.g. using models like FLUX.1 or similar diffusion
/ generative-AI models), then you want a GPU with *lots of VRAM*,
*modern tensor-cores*, and good memory bandwidth --- because these
determine how big models you can load and how fast your generation will
run. [[Propel RC+2Tom\'s

**🔝 High-end / Future-proof (Large models, high-res, heavy workloads)**

- **NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 24 GB GDDR6X** --- 24 GB VRAM still makes
  this a classic for large models (SDXL, FLUX, big batch sizes, high-res
  output). Good trade-off if you want top-level performance without
  going full workstation.

- **PNY NVIDIA RTX 5000 ADA Graphics Card** --- More of a "prosumer /
  workstation" card: likely massive VRAM / compute headroom, useful if
  you plan heavy experimentation, many generated images in batch, or
  maybe some training/fine-tuning.

**⚖️ Balanced Mid-to-High (Good for most use-cases; efficient &
versatile)**

- **NVIDIA RTX 4000 SFF Ada 20 GB Graphics Card** --- 20 GB VRAM and
  good tensor/core architecture give plenty of room for modern diffusion
  models, even larger ones or multiple models loaded simultaneously.

- **PNY Nvidia 2000 ADA 16 GB Graphics Card** --- 16 GB VRAM is often a
  "sweet spot" for many current-generation diffusion models if you don't
  push extreme high-res or batch sizes. Good price-to-performance ratio
  for creative AI workflows.

**🧪 Professional / Inference-oriented (For heavier workloads /
multipurpose)**

- **NVIDIA L4 24 GB GDDR6 GPU** --- More enterprise-class /
  compute-oriented GPU; if you are serious about heavy image generation
  or long sessions, this gives VRAM and stability that help avoid
  bottlenecks.

- **HP NVIDIA Quadro M5000 GPU Module** --- Older workstation-class GPU;
  could work if you find good second-hand deals, though not
  state-of-the-art for 2025.

**💡 Budget / Entry-level (Good for experimentation, smaller models)**

- **GIGABYTE AMD Radeon RX 9060 XT Graphics Card** --- Lower-cost GPU,
  okay for lightweight or quantized versions of models, smaller images
  or lower resolutions; not ideal for heavy workloads, but fine to start
  experimenting.

- **Acer Nitro Radeon RX 9060 XT OC Graphics Card** --- Similar to
  above; acceptable for entry-level and "just try things out" workflows.

**🧠 What "Model Sizes / Names" you can reasonably run with different
GPUs**

- With 24 GB+ VRAM (like RTX 3090 or workstation GPUs): you can
  comfortably run large models (e.g. high-capacity versions of FLUX,
  high-res output, larger batch sizes, maybe even moderate fine-tuning).
  [[poolcompute.com+2UMA
  Technology+2]{.underline}](https://www.poolcompute.com/blog/stable-diffusion?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- With 16 -- 20 GB VRAM: good for most modern diffusion models ---
  including mid-size and many "SDXL/FLUX-style" ones --- especially if
  you stick to single-image generation or moderate-resolution outputs.
  [[iRender Cloud Rendering
  Service+1]{.underline}](https://irendering.net/recommend-best-hardware-for-stable-diffusion-in-2025-with-irender/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- With \~8--12 GB VRAM (budget GPUs): you're limited to smaller or
  quantized models, lower resolutions, maybe slower generation, and
  likely no large batch processing. Works well for experimentation.

  Developers+1]{.underline}](https://www.xda-developers.com/best-gpus-for-stable-diffusion/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**🎯 My Recommendation Based on Your Use**

Since you're in Paris and presumably building a workstation for "home
image manipulation / AI generation", if you want **top performance and
flexibility**, go for an RTX 3090 or a modern workstation-class 24 GB+
card.\
If you want a **balanced, efficient setup** that's powerful but more
reasonable in price/power use, a 16--20 GB card (like the PNY 2000 ADA
or RTX 4000-class) is often the most practical "sweet spot."\
If you are just **starting out / experimenting**, a budget GPU with
8--12 GB is acceptable --- but expect limitations with big models or
high resolution.

If you want --- I can **pull up 5--10 of the *best value-for-money GPUs*
in 2025** for AI image generation (i.e. best performance per euro)
**targeted for users in Europe (availability / price-to-performance
optimized)**.\
Do you want me to build that list for you now?

**You said:**

I have a rtx3060 12 gig. A second machine with two gtx1080 ti What is
the next step up? I use flex/comfy

**ChatGPT said:**

Given that you already have a NVIDIA RTX 3060 12 GB and a second machine
with two GTX 1080 Ti --- you're solid for entry- and mid-level AI image
generation (ComfyUI / FLUX etc.). [[Aiarty+2Best GPUs for
AI+2]{.underline}](https://www.aiarty.com/stable-diffusion-guide/stable-diffusion-gpu-requirements.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\
If you want to upgrade now to get significantly faster generation,
support bigger models, higher-res output, or smoother batch workflow,
then stepping up to a "next-tier" GPU makes sense. Here are some good
upgrade options (sorted by performance / cost / headroom trade-off):

**Highlights**

- **GIGABYTE RTX 4090 GAMING OC 24GB GDDR6X** --- top-tier consumer GPU
  today. With 24 GB VRAM and a powerful tensor core setup, it gives you
  **maximum headroom**: fast image generation, ability to load large
  models or multiple models at once, smooth high-res output (e.g.
  2048×2048 or more), bigger batches, and future-proofing for upcoming
  heavy models. Great if you want "do-everything" performance at home.

- **NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 24 GB GDDR6X** --- slightly older but still
  very strong, with 24 GB VRAM. If you can find one at a good price
  (possibly used or discounted), it remains a **workhorse for
  large-model inference** and heavy AI workloads.

- **MSI GeForce RTX 4070 Ti VENTUS 3X E1 12G OC** --- a more balanced
  "value-performance" option. Good step up from a 3060: newer
  architecture, increased compute/Tensor-core efficiency, and decent
  VRAM for many models. Good for mid-size to heavy workloads without
  going into flagship price territory.

- **NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 12GB GDDR6X** --- a moderate-budget modern
  upgrade. If you don't need the absolute max VRAM, this gives you
  architectural improvements over 3060 and GTX 1080 Ti. It's a solid
  choice if you want smoother performance with recent models while
  staying in a modest budget.

- **NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti 12GB GDDR6X** --- older high-end card;
  decent compute power and probably faster than your 3060/1080 Ti in
  many tasks. Worth considering if you find it at a good price.

- **GIGABYTE GeForce RTX 3080 10GB GDDR6X** --- less VRAM than ideal for
  big AI models, but if your workflows stay moderate (smaller models,
  lower-res images), it can still provide a tangible speed boost over
  3060/1080 Ti.

- **GeForce RTX 4070 SUPER VERTO 12GB GDDR6X** --- another modern
  mid-range GPU with good performance per watt and relatively up-to-date
  architecture; a fine pick if budget vs performance matters.

- **RTX 4070 Ti ASUS ROG STRIX OC 12GB** --- comparable to the other
  4070-class cards; decent "sweet-spot" choice for users upgrading from
  3060 without aiming for flagship-level spend.

**🎯 What You Gain vs Your Current Setup**

- More **VRAM (16--24 GB vs your 12 GB / 12 GB)** → you'll be able to
  run larger models, high-res outputs, and batch generation more
  reliably and without memory errors.
  [[Aiarty+2TechBloat+2]{.underline}](https://www.aiarty.com/stable-diffusion-guide/stable-diffusion-gpu-requirements.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- **Faster generation times**: newer architecture + more tensor cores →
  less waiting per image, smoother workflow, especially with
  heavier/modern models. [[Best GPUs for
  AI+1]{.underline}](https://www.bestgpusforai.com/blog/best-gpus-for-ai?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- **Better future-proofing**: newer models are trending towards more
  VRAM use (larger diffusion models, bigger context, more complex
  pipelines). Upgrading now means fewer painful upgrades later.

**✅ My Recommendation (Based on Your Use)**

Since you already run FLUX/Comfy-based workflows:

- If you want **top performance and long-term headroom**, go for **RTX
  4090** --- ideal if you want high-res, batch processing, or plan to
  dive into heavy fine-tuning or video-generation.

- If you want a **good balance** between cost, performance, and VRAM ---
  a **4070 Ti / 4070** is a very reasonable and efficient next step.

- If budget is moderate and you just want a noticeable boost over
  3060/1080 Ti --- **3080 / 3080 Ti (if priced well)** or **4070** are
  pragmatic picks.

If you like --- I can run a **2025 price vs performance comparison
table** (for the European market) --- showing *cost per VRAM per FLOP
per watt* for \~5-10 of the most relevant GPUs for AI/image-generation.\
Would you prefer I build that table for you now (given your Paris
location)?

**You said:**

My goal is photorealistic. Not speed

**ChatGPT said:**

Good clarification. If your goal is **photorealistic image generation**
rather than raw speed, then VRAM capacity and model compatibility matter
more than "iterations per second." With that in mind --- given your
current hardware (RTX 3060, two GTX 1080 Ti) --- here are what I'd
consider your **"next-step up" GPUs** for maximum flexibility, headroom,
and ability to push **high-quality / high-resolution / complex models**
(e.g. heavy variants of ComfyUI + FLUX or big diffusion models).

**🥇 Elite / "Do-Anything" Option**

- **NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 24 GB GDDR6X** --- 24 GB VRAM and modern
  architecture give you maximum headroom. Ideal if you want to produce
  large, high-resolution, photorealistic images, work with complex
  pipelines (LoRA, ControlNet, upscaling, etc.), or keep your setup
  future-proof.

**🏆 Workhorse "Pro-Level but More Affordable" Option**

- **ASUS ROG Strix NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 24 GB GDDR6X** --- still 24
  GB VRAM, enough to run heavy models and high-res outputs. Performance
  slightly behind 4090, but often a better value if found at a good
  price, especially for strictly image generation (not cutting-edge
  video).

**⚖️ Balanced Newer-Gen Option (Good trade-off speed/VRAM/price)**

- **NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 16 GB GDDR6X** --- 16 GB VRAM is often
  enough for high-res photorealistic images (especially if you manage
  memory / VRAM usage carefully), and newer Ada architecture brings
  efficiency and better tensor-core support for diffusion-based
  workflows.

- **MSI GeForce RTX 4070 Ti VENTUS 3X 12 GB GDDR6X** --- a more modest
  upgrade relative to your 3060. Not the top VRAM, but a reasonable
  middle-ground if you expect moderately heavy photorealistic outputs
  without going full flagship.

**💡 Older High-End (Value / Budget-conscious) Options**

- **ASUS TUF NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti 12 GB GDDR6X** or **NVIDIA
  GeForce RTX 3080 Ti 12 GB GDDR6X (StockX)** --- if you find them at
  good prices, they can still handle many photorealistic workloads. VRAM
  is decent, though more limited than 24 GB cards, so you might need to
  optimize (lower res, fewer control layers).

- **NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 10 GB GDDR6X Founders Edition** --- not
  ideal for top-tier photorealism (10 GB VRAM becomes a limiting factor
  for large models or high-res). Only recommended if price is very low
  and you are comfortable compromising on resolution / complexity.

- **GIGABYTE NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 24 GB GDDR6X (OC)** --- similar to
  the other 3090; a good "workhorse 24 GB" with modest overclocking
  headroom.

**📈 Why These Are Worth Upgrading --- Even for Photorealism (Not Just
Speed)**

- **VRAM matters for photorealism:** According to GPU-for-AI-image-gen
  guides, 24 GB VRAM GPUs give you "full power" --- enough headroom for
  high-resolution, multiple condition networks (e.g. ControlNet + LoRA +
  upscaling), batch runs, or complex model stacks. [[HOSTKEY --- premium
  web services
  provider+2NunarIQ+2]{.underline}](https://hostkey.com/gpu-dedicated-servers/best-gpu-for-ai-image-generation/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- **VRAM + architecture = flexibility:** Newer-gen GPUs (Ada / Ampere)
  support FP16/BF16/FP8 quantization, tensor cores, and more efficient
  memory bandwidth --- enabling heavy models to run smoothly and
  producing high-quality outputs without crashing on out-of-memory.
  [[ComfyUI
  Wiki+1]{.underline}](https://comfyui-wiki.com/en/install/install-comfyui/gpu-buying-guide?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- **Future-proofing:** AI/image generation models continue evolving:
  higher-res outputs, more conditioning layers, multiples models in one
  generation --- 24 GB (or more) VRAM gives breathing room for future
  workloads. [[HOSTKEY --- premium web services
  provider+1]{.underline}](https://hostkey.com/gpu-dedicated-servers/best-gpu-for-ai-image-generation/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**🎯 My Recommendation for *Your* Use-Case (Photorealistic +
Flex/Comfy)**

Since you're not chasing speed but photorealistic quality --- I'd aim
for **24 GB-class GPU as next step**, to maximize flexibility and reduce
limitations when using heavy photorealistic models (especially if you
experiment with higher resolution or control networks).

If budget is a concern but you still want a meaningful boost over your
current hardware, a **16 GB (or slightly lower) modern GPU** can still
work --- though you'll need to manage VRAM carefully (lower res, simpler
pipelines).

If you want --- I can **project 2--3 realistic "upgrade paths"**
(low-cost, mid-budget, high-end) --- with approximate cost in €
(Europe/France 2025) and expected capability (res, batch size, model
types).

**You said:**

What should I look for Black Friday cyber Monday. 3090s?

**ChatGPT said:**

Good question. Because your goal is **photorealistic image generation**
(not necessarily fastest generation) --- Black Friday / Cyber Monday can
be a good time to look for an upgrade GPU. But there are a few things
you should watch out for, especially with high-VRAM cards like ZOTAC
GAMING GeForce RTX 3090 Trinity OC 24GB GDDR6X or other 24 GB cards.

Here's **what you should look for and how to approach Black Friday for
your use-case** 👇

**✅ What to check during Black Friday / Cyber Monday**

- **True discount vs. price inflation** --- Many "Black Friday deals"
  simply revert GPUs to MSRP (or slightly below), so a 5-10% off isn't
  always worth it unless the card is exactly what you need. [[Digital
  Trends+1]{.underline}](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/dont-wait-black-friday-gpu-deals/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- **VRAM / memory headroom** --- Since you prioritize photorealism and
  likely larger models / high-res outputs, prefer cards with **≥ 24 GB
  VRAM**. That means older high-end cards (like the 3090) or the top
  flagship GPUs.

- **Architecture & support for AI workloads** --- Tensor cores,
  FP16/BF16 support, and good driver/optimization support can matter
  more than raw gaming throughput if you mainly run diffusion /
  generative-AI pipelines.

- **Realistic price floor (or below MSRP)** --- For a card like the 3090
  or similar, the "deal" is only worth it if the price is noticeably
  below what it usually sells for (or near the historical MSRP).
  Otherwise you may not save much.
  [[TechSpot+1]{.underline}](https://www.techspot.com/article/2928-dont-buy-a-gpu-now/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- **Stock / availability & PSU/compatibility** --- Make sure the card
  fits in your case, your PSU can supply enough power, and that
  supply/shipping logistics won't eat up the gains. [[Powers Of
  10+1]{.underline}](https://powersof10.com/best-black-friday-graphics-card-deals/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- **Avoid hype-driven "discounts" on new mid-range cards when you
  actually need VRAM headroom** --- Many deals focus on mid-range GPUs
  (good for gaming) --- but for model-heavy workloads you want
  heavy-VRAM cards. [[Windows
  Central+1]{.underline}](https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/black-friday-gpu-deals?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**🎯 Should you hunt for 3090s or other cards this Black Friday?**

Yes --- **if** you can find a 24 GB-class GPU at a *good* price. For
photorealistic AI-generation, older high-end GPUs (like 3090) can still
be among the smartest purchases, because their VRAM and memory bus/width
give you headroom many new mid-range GPUs lack.

For example:

- **ZOTAC 3090 24 GB GDDR6X** --- 24 GB VRAM gives you flexibility for
  large or multiple models, high-res outputs, or heavy pipelines.

- A high-end 24 GB card from another brand or OEM --- as long as it's
  not overpriced --- remains a strong bet, especially if your workflow
  includes large photorealistic outputs,ControlNets, LoRAs, or chaining
  models.

However --- don't treat all Black Friday GPU deals as equal. If the only
"discounts" are on lower-VRAM mid-range GPUs (12--16 GB), they may be
worthless for your use case --- unless you accept limitations in
resolution, model size, or batch complexity.

Also, some sources argue that GPU discounts during Cyber Week are often
modest, or just restore MSRP rather than offer deep savings. [[Digital
Trends+1]{.underline}](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/dont-wait-black-friday-gpu-deals/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**🧰 What you should do right now (before Black Friday ends)**

- Monitor trusted retailers (especially those shipping to France/Europe)
  for **24 GB+ GPUs** --- old-gen but VRAM-heavy cards.

- Compare historical pricing to sale price --- check price trackers or
  prior listings to know if the deal is real.

- Confirm your PSU, case, and power-requirements before purchasing.

- If you find a good 3090 (or equivalent) from a **reputable seller at a
  realistic price** --- go for it (since VRAM headroom is rare in newer
  mid-range cards).

If you like, I can **scan a dozen European retailers** (France / EU)
*right now* and **pull up any 24 GB+ GPUs (like 3090, 4090, etc.)** that
are currently discounted --- with approximate price in €.\
Do you want me to build that list for you?

**You said:**

Give me a hit list for Amazon. Com. Us.

**ChatGPT said:**

Good idea --- a "hit list" (on Amazon.com / US) focused on GPUs that
make sense for **photorealistic image generation** (i.e. high VRAM or
good compute for diffusion / ML-based image workloads). Below are
several GPUs I'd watch for in Black Friday / Cyber Monday sales ---
ordered roughly from "best overall for photorealism" down to "budget /
fallback" options.

**🔝 Premium / "Do-Anything" Options**

- **NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 24 GB GDDR6X** --- With 24 GB VRAM, this
  remains one of the best "all-around" cards for heavy diffusion /
  generative-AI workflows, high-res outputs, or stacking multiple
  models/conditioners.

- **NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 16 GB GDDR6X** --- Newer-generation
  architecture (from Ampere → Ada or similar) gives efficiency and
  modern tensor-core support. 16 GB VRAM is lower than 3090 but might
  suffice if you optimize memory usage --- good if you want newer
  architecture over raw VRAM.

**⚖️ Balanced / Versatile Picks (Good Performance per \$)**

- **GIGABYTE GeForce RTX 3080 Ti 12 GB GDDR6X** --- A solid performer if
  you find a good deal; still capable of realistic output, though VRAM
  is more limited compared to 3090.

- **PNY NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti 12 GB GDDR6X** --- Newer-gen,
  efficient, and decent for mid-range to advanced workloads without
  going flagship.

- **ASUS TUF NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti 12 GB GDDR6X** --- Similar to
  the above 4070 Ti, useful when you want a balance between price, power
  consumption, heat, and performance.

- **GeForce RTX 4070 SUPER 12 GB GDDR6X** --- A more budget-conscious
  modern GPU; may be worthwhile if you mostly run moderate-size models
  or are okay optimizing VRAM usage.

**💡 Budget-oriented / Entry High-end (If Deals Are Good)**

- **ASUS TUF GeForce RTX 3080 10 GB GDDR6X** --- Less ideal for top-end
  photorealism (10 GB VRAM is limiting), but worth considering if price
  is much lower and you accept constraints on resolution/model size.

- **GIGABYTE GeForce RTX 3080 10 GB GDDR6X Gaming OC** --- Similar
  trade-offs as above: decent compute boost over older cards, but VRAM
  is modest for heavy AI workflows.

**✅ What to Watch Out for When Buying on Amazon**

- **Seller legitimacy:** There have been reports of "fake/grafted" GPUs
  --- e.g. GPUs labeled as high-end (like 4090/4080) but internally
  modified or mis-described. [[Digital
  Trends]{.underline}](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/fake-rtx-4090-sold-on-amazon/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
  --- Always prefer "sold by Amazon" or well-known
  manufacturers/resellers (Asus, Gigabyte, PNY, etc.), not random
  marketplace third-parties.

- **VRAM vs architecture trade-offs:** Newer cards (like 4080, 4070
  series) may have better tensor-core/AI optimization, but lower VRAM
  than older 24 GB-class cards; for heavy photorealistic generation you
  may prefer VRAM headroom.

- **Real deal vs inflated "Black Friday" prices:** Sometimes discounts
  are just marketing --- compare with historical price data to ensure
  you're getting a genuine bargain.

- **PSU / case compatibility:** High-end GPUs often require more power
  and space --- ensure your system can handle the card.

**🎯 My Advice for You (Given Your Goal: Photorealistic Output, Not
Maximum Speed)**

If I were you and shopping on Amazon US during Black Friday / Cyber
Monday:

- I'd **prioritize 24 GB-class cards** first --- e.g. RTX 3090 ---
  because VRAM headroom maximizes flexibility for high-res
  photorealistic jobs.

- If price on 3090 seems excessive or stock is poor --- I'd consider a
  newer-gen card with good tensor-core support (e.g. 4080 or 4070 Ti) as
  a compromise.

- I'd avoid "bargain" 10 GB cards unless I'm ok with limiting resolution
  / model complexity.

If you want --- I can **scan Amazon.com live** (US marketplace) for
**all listings of 24 GB+ GPUs** (3090 / 3090 Ti / 4090 if available) ---

France).\
Do you want me to build that list now?

**You said:**

Most of those make no sense. I already have a 12 and a dual 12

**ChatGPT said:**

You're right --- given that you already own a 12 GB card (and even a
dual-GPU system), some of the older "cheap mid-range" upgrades I
mentioned are probably not worth it. What matters most now is **VRAM
headroom**, **memory bandwidth / architecture**, and **real upgrade
value** --- especially if you want to push for photorealism, bigger/more
complex models and future-proofing.
[[Cameraegg+2simplepod.ai+2]{.underline}](https://www.cameraegg.org/test/best-gpu-for-ai-image-generation/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Here's more focused thinking (concrete):

**🔎 Why your current setup has real limitations**

- Even though 12 GB VRAM (like on your NVIDIA RTX 3060) is okay for
  "basic to mid" image-generation (512×512--768×768, simpler models), it
  becomes a bottleneck when you:

  - want high-resolution images (1024×1024 +), especially photorealistic
    or heavily conditioned ones.
    [[aihardwareprices.com+2Hyperbolic+2]{.underline}](https://www.aihardwareprices.com/learn/intro-to-vram/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

  - try to stack multiple models/conditioners (e.g. LoRA, ControlNet,
    upscaling, extra conditioning) --- VRAM adds up.
    [[Cameraegg+2simplepod.ai+2]{.underline}](https://www.cameraegg.org/test/best-gpu-for-ai-image-generation/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

  - work with bigger or newer models (or future versions) which tend to
    demand more VRAM than older simple diffusion models.
    [[bacloud.com+1]{.underline}](https://www.bacloud.com/en/blog/163/guide-to-gpu-requirements-for-running-ai-models.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- Also: two separate 12 GB-cards (e.g. your dual-GPU machine) **do not**
  add VRAM together for a single image generation job. VRAM doesn't
  stack across GPUs that way.
  [[bacloud.com+1]{.underline}](https://www.bacloud.com/en/blog/163/guide-to-gpu-requirements-for-running-ai-models.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

So: if your aim is **photorealism + flexibility + future-proofing**, a
"slightly better 12 GB or 16 GB card" is often **not enough**.

**✅ What kind of GPU does make sense *next* --- given your current
gear**

If you decide to upgrade, these are the meaningful "step-up" classes
that actually give you more headroom (VRAM + modern architecture), and
are worth considering --- rather than intermediate GPUs that only
incrementally improve speed.

**🔝 "True Upgrade --- VRAM + headroom"**

- **ASUS ROG Strix NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 24 GB GDDR6X** --- 24 GB VRAM
  gives you the breathing room for high-res (e.g. 2K, 4K), multiple
  models/conditioners, heavy photorealistic workloads, or large batch
  renders. Still a "workhorse" in 2025 for generative-AI.

- **Gigabyte NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti 24 GB GDDR6X** --- if you find
  one, the 3090 Ti brings nice performance and same 24 GB headroom ---
  good for intensive pipelines or future-proofing.

- **MSI GeForce RTX 4090 Gaming X Trio 24 GB GDDR6X** --- the "top-end"
  (consumer) card: 24 GB VRAM + best GPU architecture, ideal if you want
  maximum headroom for whatever future models/practices come.

- **MSI GeForce RTX 3090 Ventus 3X 24 GB GDDR6X OC** --- a slightly more
  affordable / OC version of 3090 if you're buying used or discounted,
  still giving full VRAM headroom.

**⚠️ "Mid-range / modest upgrade" --- probably not enough long-term**

- **PNY NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti 12 GB GDDR6X** --- modern GPU &
  faster than your 3060, but VRAM stays 12 GB, which still limits you
  for high-res / heavy model stacks.

- **ASUS TUF NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti 12 GB GDDR6X** --- similar
  story: good efficiency and speed, but VRAM headroom is same as your
  existing 12 GB, so benefit is limited.

- **NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 SUPER 12 GB GDDR6X** and **Gigabyte GeForce
  RTX 4070 Ti Gaming OC 12 GB GDDR6X** --- might give you slightly
  better speed or efficiency for "moderate" tasks, but none will
  dramatically expand what you *can* do.

**🎯 My View: What your "Next Move" Should Be --- If Photorealism &
Flexibility Is the Goal**

Since your aim isn't just speed, but **serious photorealistic work +
future-proofing**, I think your next upgrade should aim for **24
GB-class cards**. That means something like a 3090 (or 4090 if budget
gives) --- not just a "faster 12 GB card."

Upgrading to another 12 GB/16 GB card might give smoother performance,
but it won't *unlock* new capabilities (e.g. 2048×2048+ resolution,
heavy pipelines, multi-model stacks, complex conditioning, future large
models). Over time, VRAM headroom becomes a real practical limit in
generative-AI work.
[[simplepod.ai+2Cameraegg+2]{.underline}](https://simplepod.ai/blog/when-to-use-rtx-3090-on-the-cloud-deep-learning-rendering-and-beyond/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

If you like --- I can **simulate** (with approximate VRAM budgets) what
a "photorealistic-ready" pipeline looks like with **12 GB**, **16 GB**,
and **24 GB** cards --- to show you concretely what you **can vs can't**
do in each case (resolutions, batch size, model stacks). Might help you
see if your 12 GB-based setup is actually "good enough" or not. Want me
to build that table for you now?

**You said:**

What prices are good for the 3090? Also I have a builder that gets
parts. What is a used one going for. (Only interested in 24+gig vram
boards. )

**ChatGPT said:**

Good questions --- what counts as a "good price" for a NVIDIA GeForce
RTX 3090 (or any 24+ GB-VRAM board) depends a bit on condition (new vs
used), seller, and how much you care about warranty / wear. Based on
recent market data (2025), here's my take on what you should aim for ---
and what to expect if you or your builder jump on one now.

**✅ What a "Good Price" Looks Like (New or Well-Maintained Used)**

- For a **used RTX 3090** in good condition (not abused by mining, with
  working fans, no damage, stable), a price around **€650 -- €800** (or
  roughly **US \$700 -- \$850**) is considered reasonable. [[Best Value
  GPU+2leboncoin+2]{.underline}](https://bestvaluegpu.com/en-eu/history/new-and-used-rtx-3090-price-history-and-specs/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- Lower than that (say €600 / US \$650) --- that could be a "very good
  deal," but only if you **thoroughly inspect it** (fans, VRAM
  stability, booting, temps) --- especially since cheap GPUs can hide
  issues. Many buyers on forums note that sub-€600 listings are often
  risky or end up being "for parts only."
  [[Reddit+2Reddit+2]{.underline}](https://www.reddit.com/r/PcBuild/comments/1ep4as7?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- If you see a clean and recent-generation 3090 at **\~€750--€850**,
  that's sort of the "sweet spot" for value vs headroom.

In short: used \~€700--€800 is very solid for a 24 GB VRAM GPU nowadays.

**📈 What You're Likely to See on the Used / Resale Market (and Should
Expect)**

- On some European second-hand markets (e.g. classifieds, local resale
  sites), people report seeing 3090 cards at **€580--€750**, though
  often these go quickly and may come with caveats (shipping, testing,
  warranty).
  [[leboncoin+1]{.underline}](https://www.leboncoin.fr/ck/ordinateurs/carte-graphique-3090?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- On larger marketplaces / aggregated trackers, the "average" used-price
  marker is around **€686** (for functional boards) --- confirming that
  \~€650--€750 is close to what "normal" 3090s are trading for in
  late-2025. [[Best Value
  GPU]{.underline}](https://bestvaluegpu.com/en-eu/history/new-and-used-rtx-3090-price-history-and-specs/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- Naturally, "top-end" partner-cards (custom cooled, lightly used) fetch
  more --- so if you find one of those for \~€800, that's reasonable. If
  a listing asks \~€1200+, you're likely paying a premium for
  convenience / "like new" condition --- maybe less interesting unless
  warranty/new-box is included.
  [[leboncoin+2Idealo+2]{.underline}](https://www.leboncoin.fr/ck/ordinateurs/nvidia-3090?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**🎯 My Recommendation to You (Given Your Goals & What You Already
Have)**

Since your goal is photorealistic image-generation and VRAM headroom
matters more than "latest-gen," I'd say:

- Try to get a used 3090 around **€700--€800** → that is where price
  meets value.

- Accept **€650** only if you *can check* the card thoroughly (fans,
  temps, stress-test) --- great bargain but a little riskier.

- Avoid paying above **€900--€1000** unless the card is basically "like
  new," from a reliable vendor, and comes with warranty or proof of
  "light use."

Given the investment, that gives you the VRAM headroom for big models,
high-res images, multi-model stacks --- while still offering good value
per euro.

If you want: I can **scan 5 major US + EU resale marketplaces (eBay,
Reddit hardware swap, local resale, etc.)** and pull up **20--30 recent
RTX 3090 listings** --- with **price, condition, and seller-type**, so
you get a global sense of what the "real market" looks like *today*.\

**ChatGPT said:**

Good call asking about NVIDIA RTX 3090 prices --- using a marketplace
like Marktplaats (and related NL/EU second-hand / resale markets) is
often one of the better ways to snag a 24 GB+ VRAM GPU for generative-AI
/ photoreal work at reasonable cost. Here's what recent real-world
listings on Marktplaats show (and what I'd consider "good prices /
red-flags" based on that).

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**What stands out**

- There **are** functional 24 GB 3090 cards (various brands) going for
  **€650-€700** --- these are among the lowest price points in recent
  listings and seem to frequently be "normal use, not mined, decent
  condition."

- Slightly more premium cards (partner-brand, water-cooled, or "top-end
  OC" versions) sit around **€700-€800**.

- As with any second-hand market: condition, seller credibility, and
  tested functionality vary --- some list explicitly as "works fine,"
  others give little info (which raises risk).

**🎯 What a "Good Price" for 3090 Means --- Based on This Market**

- **€650 -- €700** --- this is roughly the "sweet-spot" for used 3090:
  reasonable VRAM headroom, and price that makes the upgrade worthwhile
  considering your usage (AI / image generation).

- **€700 -- €800** --- still fair, especially if the card is in good
  condition (fans working, no mining history, some minimal wear) or a
  nice partner-board model (better cooling, custom PCB, etc.).

- **\> €850** --- only worth it if it's basically "like new," comes with
  original box/accessories, maybe a short warranty or seller proof, or
  water-cooled / special edition --- otherwise you're not getting much
  extra compared to lower-priced ones.

Given what you already have (12 GB on 3060, dual-GPU 1080 Ti rig), I'd
say anything **≤ €700-€750** is a *good value* for 24 GB VRAM headroom.

**⚠️ What to Watch Out For / When to Be Careful**

- Some cards may have been used for mining --- that wears down VRAM
  chips and fans; always ask for usage history and test under load
  (temps, artifacts).

- Avoid listings with little info or vague "works fine" statements ---
  ideally prefer ones where the seller allows inspection or live testing
  (fan noise, temps, benchmark).

- Beware of scams: always prefer local / pick-up if possible or secure
  payment methods; second-hand GPUs are medium-risk compared to
  brand-new hardware.

- Check that card fits your system (case, PSU, connectors) --- 3090 is
  large, draws significant power; good VRM cooling & PSU needed.

**✅ My Recommendation (Given Your Context)**

If I were you and browsing Marktplaats (or similar NL/EU second-hand
markets) for a 3090:

- I'd aim for **€650--€700 first** --- filter listings carefully, ask
  questions about usage/condition.

- If none show up at that range, consider **€700--€750** as the upper
  "safe zone" before diminishing returns --- especially for
  well-maintained partner cards.

- I'd skip anything \> €850 unless there is a very good reason (like
  brand-new, warranty, special cooling, water-block, etc.).

If you like --- I can fetch **10--15 live 24 GB+ GPU listings** from
*all* major NL/EU marketplaces (Marktplaats, second-hand forums, even
wider EU) **translated to €** and mark which ones are "good value now,"
"watch closely," or "overpriced."\
Want me to build that list for you now?

**You said:**

Yes

**ChatGPT said:**

Cool --- I dug through a number of recent resale / second-hand listings
across European marketplaces (Belgium, NL, France, pan-EU sales) and
found a **snapshot** of \~15--20 actual NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 (and
similar 24 GB-VRAM 3090 boards) --- prices, conditions, and what seems
like "good value vs overpriced." This should give you a better feel for
what's "reasonable now."

**What stands out from the list**

- The "average used-market" price for a working 24 GB 3090 tends to
  cluster around **\~€650 -- €750** --- e.g. one listing at about €686
  (per a recent EU price tracker) for functional used cards. [[Best

Now)**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Price range /         **Assessment**
  Condition**             
  ----------------------- -----------------------------------------------
  **€600 -- €650**        ✅ Very good value --- ideal if you're ok with
  (working card, seller   potential slight wear and verify functional
  lets you test)          state before purchase.

  **€650 -- €750**        ✅ "Sweet-spot" --- good balance of VRAM
  (normal used, decent    headroom + value; great for photoreal models +
  condition)              long-term use.

  **€750 -- €800**        ✅ Acceptable if card condition seems good and
  (partner / custom-PCB / seller is reliable --- gives longer lifespan
  well-kept)              potential.

  **€800 -- €900+**       ⚠️ Acceptable but less "value-efficient." Worth
  (near-new, minimal      it only if you need guaranteed reliability,
  wear, maybe warranty or warranty or special build; otherwise
  extras)                 diminishing returns vs cheaper ones.

  **\< €600** or          ⚠️ Higher risk --- only consider if you can
  "suspiciously cheap /   test it thoroughly, ideally in-person before
  no seller history"      paying.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

**🎯 My "What I'd Do If I Were You" (Given Your Goals & Location)**

If I were you and browsing right now for a 24 GB+ card for
photorealistic AI generation:

- I'd aim for a 3090 priced **€650--€750**, preferably from a seller
  that allows **testing and verifying the card works under load** (fans,
  temps, driver install, memory test).

- I'd treat **€600--€650** offers as "good but potential risk" --- only
  go for them if seller seems honest and conditions allow testing (or
  meet in person).

- I'd avoid anything **\> €850--€900** unless it's certified "like new"
  or comes from a reputable reseller --- for my use case, not worth
  paying a big premium.

Given what you already have (12 GB cards), getting a 24 GB 3090 in the
"sweet-spot" range pretty much unlocks headroom for big photoreal models
and future-proofed workloads --- and seems worth it *only* if price
stays reasonable.

If you want --- I can also **filter the list** further to **cards sold
from EU sellers** only (avoid import complexity/shipping); that might be
more relevant for you in Paris/Europe.
