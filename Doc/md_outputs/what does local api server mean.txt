C. Local API Server

@Serve Mode (--serve): You can start a lightweight local HTTP server that exposes an
OpenAl-compatible API for the LLMs configured in aichat. This means that any
existing application, script, or framework (like LangChain) written to use the
standard OpenAl API can be seamlessly re-routed to use your local aichat server

and the models it hosts (e.g., gemma3:4b), simply by changing the api_base URL.
