**LLM Recommendations for**

**Programming and Development**

Based on the capability tags and descriptions provided in your model list, here is a breakdown 

of which Large Language Models (LLMs) are best suited for your specific programming and 

general tasks. 

The key capabilities we looked for were **Tools** , **Thinking/Reasoning** , **Code** , **Agentic**

**workflows** , and **Vision**. 

**1\. Refactoring, New Code Creation, and Debugging**

For tasks involving specific programming languages (py, html, xcode) and complex 

frameworks like Apple Vision Pro, you need models with strong reasoning, tool-use, and 

dedicated coding proficiency. 

**Model**

**Key Tags/Description**

**Rationale**

**qwen3-coder**

tools, cloud, long context 

Dedicated coding model with 

tool-use capability, ideal for 

complex tasks and handling 

large codebases (long 

context). 

**glm-4.6**

Advanced agentic, reasoning 

and coding capabilities 

Explicitly built for coding and 

agentic (automated task) 

capabilities, making it excellent 

for debugging and refactoring. 

**minimax-m2**

built for coding and agentic 

workflows 

High-efficiency model focused 

on automated coding 

workflows, very useful for 

large-scale refactoring and 

generating new blocks of 

code. 

**kimi-k2**

real-world coding agent tasks Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) 

model showing strong 

performance on agentic and 

coding tasks, beneficial for 

complex development. 

**deepseek-r1**

tools thinking 

Strong focus on reasoning and 

tool usage, which is critical for 

complex debugging and 

structural refactoring. 

**firefunction-v2**

function calling model 

Excellent for scenarios where 

the code needs to interact with

external systems or APIs, such 

as integrating code 

functionality. 

**2\. General Questions and Conversational Use**

These models are optimized for natural language conversation, summarization, and answering 

broad inquiries, making them suitable for research, documentation, or quick Q&A. 

**Model**

**Key Tags/Description**

**Rationale**

**alfred**

A robust conversational model Explicitly designed for general 

chat and instruct use cases, 

making it a reliable choice for 

everyday questions. 

**notus**

A 7B chat model 

A focused chat model 

fine-tuned for high-quality 

conversational interaction. 

**qwen3**

tools thinking 

A versatile model family that 

can handle both general Q&A 

(due to strong reasoning) and 

more advanced tasks. 

**goliath**

combining two fine-tuned 

Llama 2 70B models 

The large parameter size 

suggests high capability for 

general knowledge and 

complex reasoning typically 

required for conversational 

models. 

**3\. Manipulating and Understanding Images**

For tasks involving images, such as analyzing existing images, creating visual content, or 

interpreting image data for Apple Vision Pro applications, you need a model with **vision**

capabilities. 

**Model**

**Key Tags/Description**

**Rationale**

**qwen3-vl**

The most powerful 

vision-language model 

This model is the top choice, 

as it's specifically described as 

a powerful Vision-Language 

(VL) model for understanding 

and potentially manipulating 

image content. 

**gemma3**

vision 

Explicitly labeled with the 

vision tag, indicating it has 

multimodal capabilities

necessary for image 

understanding tasks. 

This analysis should give you a good starting point for matching your tasks to the right LLM!
