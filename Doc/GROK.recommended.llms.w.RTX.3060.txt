Yes – your Aspire TC-885 + RTX 3060 12GB + Ollama setup will be excellent for local coding assistance and will easily replace Claude 3.5 / Gemini 1.5 Pro / GitHub Copilot Pro for the kind of Python and HTML/web-dev work you do. You’ll save the $20/month Copilot Pro fee and everything stays private on your own machine.Expected Real-World Coding Performance (RTX 3060 12GB)Model (quantized)

Surprisingly good & very fast
Great if you want maximum speed

My Personal Recommended Stack for Your Use Case (Python + HTML/JS/web dev)Daily driver (best balance) → DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite 16B Q4_K_M  Trained specifically on code, beats Claude 3.5 Sonnet on many coding benchmarks in 2025.  
Handles multi-file Python projects, FastAPI, Django, React/Vue/HTML+Tailwind, etc.  
128k context = you can feed it your entire small-to-medium project.

Speed demon (when you just want instant completions) → Qwen2.5-Coder 7B or Llama 3.1 8B Q8  Feels like Copilot but 100 % local and no latency.

Nuclear option (when you need maximum reasoning) → Llama 3.1 70B Q3_K_M (offload ~50 layers to GPU, rest on CPU/RAM)  Basically Claude-3.5-level quality locally.

How to Set It Up for Copilot-Like Experience (VS Code)Install these free extensions (all work perfectly with Ollama):Continue (my favorite – https://continue.dev) → inline completions, chat panel, @files
, @codebase

Bottom LineWith the 3060 12GB you can:Cancel Copilot Pro today and never look back
Run models that are equal or better than Claude 3.5/Gemini 1.5 Pro for coding
Keep everything 100 % private and offline
Have <200 ms response times instead of cloud latency

Just pull DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite 16B first:



ollama run deepseek-coder-v2-lite:16b-q4_k_m

Here's a quick reality-check and clean-up plan for your current Ollama library, plus exactly what you should do once your RTX 3060 12GB arrives.Current Situation on GTX 1050 (4 GB VRAM)Almost everything in your list marked “cloud” or the huge 120B–671B models are not actually running locally — Ollama is just proxying them to third-party APIs (Moonshot, DeepSeek API, Zhipu, etc.).
The only models that are truly local right now are the tiny ones (1–4B) that fit in 4 GB:tinyllama:latest (1.1B)  
qwen2.5:1.5b  
gemma2:2b  
phi3:mini (3.8B)  
qwen2.5-coder:1.5b  
gemma3:1b / 4b (barely fit quantized)

Everything else (deepseek-r1, qwen3-coder, the 480B/671B monsters, etc.) is just costing you API money and latency while giving the illusion of being local.What to Do the Day the RTX 3060 ArrivesDelete or archive everything except the tiny ones you might still want for quick tests.
Pull these five models — they’re the current 2025 kings for coding and general use on exactly 12 GB VRAM:

When you need absolute maximum intelligence

One-Line Commands to Get the Good Stuff Fast



ollama pull deepseek-coder-v2-lite:16b-q4_k_m
ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:7b-instruct-q8_0
ollama pull llama3.1:8b-instruct-q8_0
ollama pull codestral:22b-v0.1-q4_k_m

(Optionally add the 70B later when you want to flex.)Clean-Up Command (Free Up Disk + Stop Paying for Cloud)Remove all the fake-local cloud models in one shot:



ollama rm gpt-oss:120b-cloud qwen3-coder:480b-cloud deepseek-v3.1:671b-cloud \
          kimi-k2-thinking:cloud minimax-m2:cloud glm-4.6:cloud \
          deepseek-r1:latest qwen3-coder:latest

Final Result After UpgradeYou’ll go from:Paying for cloud APIs + waiting 1–3 seconds per response
to  
100 % free, private, 50–90 tokens/sec locally, zero latency, better-than-Claude quality for Python/HTML/JS work.

Do the cleanup, install the five models above, hook Continue.dev (or Tabby) in VS Code, and you can cancel GitHub Copilot Pro the same day the 3060 boots up. You’re going to love it.
